# Eat all the cookies on the tray!

Magic Cookies is our first commercially released Haskell game for Android.

Please note that this game is currently **not** open source. We are merely using this repository for issue tracking, so that github users have a quick and easy way to report issues, communicate with us and be notified when they are solved.

# Installation
Our game is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.keera.games.magiccookies).

# Something doesn't work
Sorry to hear that. Please, open a new [issue](https://github.com/keera-studios/magic-cookies/issues/new) or send an email to [support@keera.co.uk](mailto:support@keera.co.uk).

# Follow us!
We often comment on our progress on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/keerastudios) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/KeeraStudios). Please, follow us. Everything we publish has to do with multimedia and games in Haskell and other Functional languages.

# FAQ
## What technology have you used?
The game is written in Haskell, with a C and Java wrapper that merely invokes our Haskell main. It uses SDL2 for multimedia. The core is written in the Functional Reactive Programming library [Yampa](http://github.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa).

## Is your game open source?
Not currently. Some of the (general purpose) code does make it into public and open source projects, though.

You may want to take a look at the Open Source game [Haskanoid](http://github.com/ivanperez-keera/haskanoid), which supports Wiimote & Kinect and is also written in Haskell using [Yampa](http://github.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa).

## Isn't it a bit strange, to use github for a closed-source project?
Possibly, but Github doesn't have a problem with that (other companies, like Valve, are doing the same thing).

We also publish [open source code on github](https://github.com/keera-studios).

Github offers a great issue tracking system. There's no reason to force users to create new accounts somewhere else, or to give us their confidential email addresses.

# Thank you
We'd like to thank:
* The Haskell community, for creating such an awesome language and the right tools to build this. In particular, we'd like to thank the creators of the GHC Android backend.
* The Haskell Facebook group for their constant praise and encouragement.
* Everyone who wrote to us to encourage us to keep working.
* Our beta testers, who put up with slow, heavy, boring versions until we got to a reasonably stable version. For privacy reasons, we cannot name names, but thanks to all of you for your help.
* Those who buy the app. Please buy the app! We only get a very small fee for every customer, so we need to sell thousands to be able to get enough money to pay the bills and publish the next game.
